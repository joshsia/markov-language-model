# Markov language model

Author: Joshua Sia

Personal project inspired from UBC Master of Data Science Course DSCI 521.

### About

A Markov model of an input text, known as a corpus, is learned and can be used to synthesise text. The model learns all possible *n*-grams in the corpus as well as the possible characters that can follow a given *n*-gram. A random text of specified length can then be generated one character at a time from the learned model.
